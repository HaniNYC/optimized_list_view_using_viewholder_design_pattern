optimized_list_view_using_viewholder_design_pattern
===================================================

This Android ListView Tutorial Video shows how to optimize the ListView in Android using a design pattern called ViewHolder design pattern. The inspiration behind this design pattern is to reduce the number of calls to the LayoutInflater that is responsible for creating a single row using the inflate method and to reduce the number of times findViewById is called to locate the Views from the View Hierarchy that constitute a single row of your ListView. This pattern improves the ListView performance by 175%
